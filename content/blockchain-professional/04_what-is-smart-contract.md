Smart contracts use blockchain technology to facilitate the exchange of money, property, information or anything that people deem appropriate to initiate a smart contract for.

The beauty of the decentralized nature of blockchain based peer to peer transactions means that these smart contracts don’t require anything in the way of a middleman. Traditionally individuals or institutions such as banks and solicitors were required to facilitate legally binding contracts. Smart contracts allow individuals to bypass these costly and often slow middlemen and agree on a contract directly.

Smart contracts are applications that run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine(public Blockchain). This is a decentralized “world computer” where the computing power is provided by all those Ethereum nodes. Any nodes providing computing power are paid for that resource in Ether tokens.

* __Autonomy__: Decentralized nature of the blockchain contracts underlying these smart contracts as well as the nature of the contract themselves means no outside party is required in the process.
* __More secure__: Blockchain technology creates unalterable ledgers which provide definitive proof of transactions. It also relies on encryption while operating as a secure peer to peer transaction system.
* __Faster speeds__: Without the need for a middleman, speeds are much faster.
* __Increased accuracy__: Humans make mistakes, smart contracts are designed not to.
* __Cost savings__: Automated process lowers costs significantly.
* __Trust__: Unalterable ledgers mean transactions are set in stone
* __Backup__: Data storage devices can fail. Smart contracts duplicate all transactions so that all parties have a record of the transitions. The likelihood that all parties are going to suffer data storage failures is practically nonexistent.

### Advantages of Smart Contracts

* NEO blockchain based platforms offer terrific data safety and maintenance of transaction history.

* Crypto currency can be transferred in the most secured manner on systems that are powered by blockchain technology.
* Chance of mistakes has been significantly reduced in money transaction for creating deals.
