### Beyond Bitcoin & first generation decentralized applications
Although normally associated with Bitcoin, blockchain science has many other purposes that go way past digital currencies. In fact, Bitcoin is only one of quite a few hundred purposes that use blockchain technology today.

Until relatively recently, building blockchain applications has required a complex background in coding, cryptography, mathematics as well as significant resources. But times have changed. Previously unimagined applications, from electronic voting & digitally recorded property assets to regulatory compliance & trading are now actively being developed and deployed faster than ever before. By providing developers with the tools to build decentralized applications, [Ethereum is making all of this possible.](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper)

In the Ethereum blockchain, instead of mining for bitcoin, miners work to earn Ether, a type of crypto token that fuels the network. Beyond a tradeable Cryptocurrency Ether is also used by application developers to pay for transaction fees and services on the Ethereum network.

There is a second type of token that is used to pay miners fees for including transactions in their block, it is called gas, and every smart contract execution requires a certain amount of gas to be sent along with it to entice miners to put it in the blockchain.
