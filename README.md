__Learn how to become a blockchain professional__

Blockchain technology has been predicted to disrupt and change the operations of multiple industries. In 2018, [blockchain adoption as an IoT security tool has doubled](https://www.gemalto.com/press/Pages/Almost-half-of-companies-still-can-t-detect-IoT-device-breaches-reveals-Gemalto-study.aspx). As a fast evolving industry, the demand in blockchain engineers and talents with blockchain knowledge has surged throughout the years. Various proof-of-concepts have been developed to move the industry closer to mass adoption. Most people are familiar with cryptocurrency, however blockchain development and use cases are moving beyond trading and speculation. The technology has been used for voting, food safety and shipping. By looking at the past trends, we can predict that demand for blockchain talents in future will increase as more organisations see the benefits of blockchain technology and start adopting it.

Many organisations are desperately looking for high-quality talent in this discipline, which is extremely limited, as of now. Hence, with limited qualified candidates, the salaries offered by a blockchain company are relatively higher than in other traditional jobs. According to [global stats provided to CNBC by Hired](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/21/how-much-do-blockchain-engineers-make.html), blockchain engineers are earning between $150,000 and $175,000 on average. According to Hired, a typical software engineer earn on average $135,000. Having said that, the blockchain field also offers a career of exciting challenges for enterprising and innovative individual.

At Xinfin, we believe in the mission of decentralisation. Blockchain technology can be utilised to solve the inefficiency between intermediaries in the operations of large corporations. On the other hand, there are also many companies and organisations exploring the use of blockchain to catalyze tremendous economic and social change. And at the heart of the spectrum of use cases, lies the importance of educating and empowering more engineers and professionals on the blockchain technology.

At our blockchain education portal, we provide free online blockchain courses, that will take you through a structured curriculum from basic blockchain course to professional blockchain course. It also include insights and real life applications that we as a blockchain company has encountered and developed.

# An overview of the blockchain courses
The structure of the courses are designed to equip the students with strong fundamental blockchain knowledge. We focus on imparting knowledge that will make you industry ready. You are not required to have any prior knowledge of blockchain as we will build you up with the relevant information.

## Blockchain basic course
We will go through the fundamental of blockchain, from history, to use cases to future predictions. Blockchain as a distributed ledger technology has seen tremendous evolution from the first generation blockchain: digital currency, to the third generation blockchain: platforms that are able to offer reliable and scalable solution. You will also learn about the definition of blockchain and the benefits of blockchain. From a technical standpoint, we will explore the distinctions between blockchain and traditional database and the two paradigms of blockchain technology.

After this course, you will be able to:
* Gain an understanding of the growth of blockchain technology
* Explain the principal technologies that combine to create a blockchain
* Understand the benefits and constraints of a blockchain system
* Identify and differentiate among various paradigms of blockchain

## Blockchain advanced course for engineer
Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency to be created in the blockchain sphere. It first surfaces on a paper authored by Satoshi Nakamoto. In this paper, it details the methodology of a secured peer-to-peer electronic cash system. However, a peer-to-peer network possesses the issue of double-spending, a situation whereby the digital tokens are spend twice. In order to combat the double spending problem, transactions have to be publicly announced. Satoshi proposes a technological system combining cryptographic signature, network timestamp transactions, hashed-based proof-of-work to generate a on-going chain of transactions. Essentially, the bitcoin blockchain technology is an electronic payment channel without a trusted party.

We will deep dive into the Bitcoin blockchain system in this course. Many people still mistakenly equate bitcoin to blockchain. In this course, we will dissect the differences between blockchain and bitcoin. You will find out about the different technological components of the Bitcoin blockchain as described in the original Bitcoin whitepaper. With this knowledge, you will be able to grasp the concepts that make blockchain possible and why a trustless system is often used to describe blockchain technology. This course will not be complete without hands-on interaction with the public Bitcoin blockchain. Learn to be part of the Bitcoin network.

After this course, you will be able to:
* Understand and articulate the difference between bitcoin and blockchain
* Learn the advanced theory of the Bitcoin protocol
* Setup your own Bitcoin node and see how transactions are stored and recorded

## Blockchain advanced course for professional
Ethereum is the first blockchain technology to provide smart contracts and decentralised application(DApp) platform. A smart contract is a "contract" created on the blockchain with a built-in fully fledged Turing-complete programming language. Smart contracts allow users to create arbitrary rules for ownership, transaction formats and state transition functions. For example, a smart contract could be used in a decentralised file storage ecosystem, in which individual users of the ecosystem can be rewarded with tokens by renting out their own hard drives and unused space.

With smart contracts, blockchain smart contract developers could build DApp with a rapid development cycle. In this course, we will first touch on the theory of smart contracts: popular features, potential use cases and constraints. Then, we will focus on the development process on Ethereum. We will start by teaching you the tools and setup required for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain. We will run Geth, the command line interface for running a full Ethereum node implemented in Go. Over the years, multiple tools have been developed to make DApp development and testing easier. You will get to create DApp and learn the various tools, like truffle framework, ganache and metamask to become proficient in development of smart contracts and DApp.

After this course, you will be able to:
* Explain the differences between Ethereum blockchain and the first generation blockchain
* Set up Geth and run a public Ethereuem node or set up your own private blockchain network
* Understand the principles of a smart contract
* Develop your own DApp with smart contracts

# Our partnerships
We work with various industry and educational institutions to uphold the academic integrity of our blockchain programs. Currently, we work with Sardar Patel Institute of Technology College (SPIT college) in Mumbai, Karamshi Jethabhai Somaiya College (K.J Somiya College) in Mumbai and Temasek Polytechnic in Singapore. Besides online training, we have conducted our 8 hours classroom blockchain training program in association with SPIT college and K.J Somiya College. In order to kickstart and nurture blockchain talents, Xinfin is also an active participant in various hackathons across the globe. We are actively seeking education institutions to join us in our mission to make blockchain education easily available.

# What's next?
Upon successful completion of the courses, you can choose to take our blockchain examination. This exam comprises of 100 questions, 50 theory and 50 practical, to be completed within 45 minutes. The minimum passing score of the exam is above 60%. Upon passing of the exam, you will be entitled to receive a certification of competence, which will be added to the Xinfin blockchain. With the certificate on the blockchain, you will be able to check your immutable certificate using the transaction hash provided to you.

You are ready to take on roles in the blockchain industry. Also, as blockchain is an ever evolving industry, you could also choose to contribute to our content upon gaining industry insights.
