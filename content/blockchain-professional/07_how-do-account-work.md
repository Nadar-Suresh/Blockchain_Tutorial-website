One of the massive variations in blockchain applications vs traditional internet functions is that accounts are managed by means of the community itself, not always the individual application. For example, in a normal internet utility like Gmail, you create a username and password that is saved in a database owned by Google. When you use the blockchain, you have an account that represents you as a consumer of the complete network, now not simply the application. Your account is recognized by using an address, which is a illustration of its public &amp; personal key pair.

An Ethereum account address looks like this:

<div class="text-center">0x4a10a580a10a0fbe3fc1624c1d348838184d7664</div>

this is the `from` account from the above code example. This account address is represented by a hex string. It has a related account balance in Ether. Whenever you run the code example, you are in actuality sending cash from one person on the network to every other user.
