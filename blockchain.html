                                </div>
								<p>In 1991, Dr W. Scott Stornetta and his co-author Dr Stuart Haber published a whitepaper introducing
 ‘blockchain’, a decentralised, cryptic database where digital transactions are
 Secured.

<p>The journey of Blockchain started in 1991 A structure which was similar to that of Blockchain was
mentioned in a research paper titled “How to Time-Stamp a Digital Document” in 1991 by Haber and
Stornetta.</p>

     <p>According to that paper, a client sends a document to timestamp to a timestamping server and the server
        would sign the document with the current timestamp. Also, the server would link the document to the
        previous document. The pointers pointed to specific data and not the location of the document. So if the
        data changed, the pointer would become invalid. It ensured no one could tamper the data that had once
        passed through the server.</p>
     <p>
        According to this paper what was needed was a method of time-stamping digital documents with the following two properties</p>

     <p>1.Finding a way for automated time-stamping, without any reliance on the characteristics of the medium on which the data appears, so that it is impossible to change even one bit of the document without the change being apparent.</p>
 
     <p>2. It should be impossible to stamp a document with a time and date different from the actual one.</p>
     <p>Next and definitely the most important innovation leading to Blockchain was the Bitcoin. In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto published a white-paper titled “Bitcoin: A Peer to Peer Electronic Cash System”. The paper claimed that it had a solution to the double spending problem in digital currency using a peer-to-peer network. The main aim of the paper was to build a peer-to-peer version of digital currency that would enable people to spend it directly without it going in a financial institution. It was a huge innovation that enabled the user to transact directly without relying on a third party</p>
								
								<div class="transbox"><h3 class="mb-4">2.The Evolution of the Blockchain: Generation 1 to 4</h3></div>
								
								<p><h3><u>1st Generation Blockchains focus on moving value, maintaining a ledger, ideal payment systems</u></h3></p>
                                       <p>These functions represent the core of why bitcoin was created. Another core aspect to Bitcoin is the fact that it was created to be open source. By making the code behind Bitcoin open source, Satoshi Nakamoto gave anyone the opportunity to learn from, build on and expand beyond it. </p>

                                <p><h2>1.1  First Generation Blockchain Technology</h2></p>

                                <p><strong>To understand the 1st Generation blockchain technology, we need to take a look at Bitcoin’s Blockchain. Using blockchain technology, Bitcoin was able to become the first successful digital currency in the world.</strong></p>


                                <p><strong>How this was achieved was through the 1st Generation blockchain technology.
                                 Let’s have an example a Bank:</strong></p>

               <p> <h4><u>Example of a Bank:-</u></h4></p>
                          <p>Ram works as a driver. At the end of the day, he received 200 USD in tips. He takes the money to Axis Bank and deposits the money. Axis Bank updates its ledger, and ram bank account with them now shows that he has 200 USD.

                             While on the way home, he realizes that he needs some cash on hand to buy dinner. However, the only cash withdrawal machine on his way home belongs to icici bank. icici bank ledger does not show that ram has 200 USD, and he has no choice but to walk back to axis Bank  to withdraw his money.

                             More than just the inconvenience of having to walk to the right cash withdrawal machine, a centralized ledger requires a degree of trust: ram has to trust that the bank has his money, and that will return the money to him on request. If the bank’s records are erased, ram has essentially lost all his money.</p>






                            <p>How the Blockchain is different</p>

                             <p>In the blockchain, the ledger is shared with all participants, making it a decentralized, distributed ledger. Rather than having one central bank recording the transactions, everyone has a copy of the same ledger, and everyone’s ledger is updated regularly. Tampering with a single ledger would not work; if the other ledgers do not record it, it is not validated.</p>


               <p><h3>Example of 1st Generation Blockchain:-</h3></p>

                    <p>Ankit and 5 other friends have a meet-up session every day. During each session, they tell each other how much each of them has spent, and what they have spent on, over the past day. Each of them has a notebook in which they record down these payments. After they have recorded down all these transactions, they all compare notes to ensure that the results are the same. After ensuring that the results are the same, all 5 of them sign on all 5 notebooks, and they take the notebooks home until their next session.
                       There are several benefits to this method.</p>

                    <p>1. The loss of a notebook would have no impact: the records are still stored with everyone else.</p>
                    <p>2. If any one of them decide to tamper their records, it will immediately become obvious during their next sharing session. A cheater would have to break into 4 other homes, steal their notebooks, replace it with a notebook that looks exactly the same, refill in all the pages that were written on, and forge the signatures for each page before the next session. Now imagine instead of 5  friends, it’s a few thousand friends who hold this session. And instead of a session once a day, it’s once every 10 minutes.</p>

                    <p>3. There is no need to ‘trust’ one another: transactions are verified, and signed, by all members at the end of each session</p>

                    <p>Now, why Bitcoin was created?</p>

                    <p>Bitcoin Creator, the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto wanted to remove Third-Party Verification and intended to create a trustless payment mechanism with irreversible transactions. Now, such a system is helpful in remittance, private transactions, providing financial aid to people stuck in unstable countries with collapsing economies. Bitcoin is a currency without borders.</p>

                       Now supposes, you did a work-from-home internship for a startup in the USA. 
                       They paid you through Paypal.
                       Now Paypal will charge you between 2.5 to 5% of transaction fees.
                       Right now, you have USD in you Paypal account, so you have to convert it. The conversion rate of Paypal or other converters is generally 2 to 3 Rs/USD less than the actual rate.
                       And now when you finally have the INR currency in your bank account, if your balance is less than the “Minimum Balance Criterion”, you’ll be charged by your bank.

                   <p>This entire process would take a minimum of 3-5 business days.</p>

                   <p>Here, Ankit is sending $100 to Rishikesh however it ought to ignore via a trusted third celebration like a Bank or Financial service employer earlier than Hrishikesh can receive it. A transaction charges of 2% is deducted from this quantity and Hrishikesh only receives $98 at the give up of the transaction. Now this can also no longer appear a huge amount however imagine if you have been sending $100,000 rather of $100, then the transaction prices also increases to $2,000 which is a huge amount. As per a record from SNL Financial and CNNMoney, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo earned extra than $6 billion from ATM and overdraft fees in 2015</p>
							    
                       <img src="img/gallery/pasted image 2.jpg" class="center">
				       <p>Most of these expenses come under Third-Party/Broker Fees, which you pay to a trusted third party (Paypal and Your Bank) for carrying out your transactions. 

                       </p>
					   
					     <p><strong>If the startup had paid you in bitcoins, there would have been a minimal (less than the above scenario) fee and the transaction would’ve been completed in an hour.</strong> You could have used the received bitcoins from your wallet directly.     

                          </p>
						  <strong>This method of remittance is way more cheaper and faster. </strong>

													 
											
				 <p><h3><u>2nd Second generation blockchains are those like Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, NEO and QTUM to name a few.</u></h3></p>
								
							<p>These are considered the second generation because they’ve taken this idea of recording transactions on a blockchain and expanded it to incorporate programming languages. These second-generation blockchains have unleashed smart contracts. These allow for customizable transactions. You can custom create transactions to execute however best fits the needs of the parties involved.</p>			
							 <h3>1.2 Second Generation Blockchain</h3>
							 
							 <p>Second generation blockchains bought the use cases of assets in general to be maintained by a blockchain. In this generation anyone can issue shares on the blockchain. Ethereum is an example of a second generation blockchain. Ethereum has at its core a way to apply arbitrary rules for ownership, transaction formats and state transition functions, taking both the state of a blockchain and a transaction for that chain, and then outputting a new state as its result.</p>

<p>To understand this, we now take a closer look at Ethereum. Often paired together with Bitcoin as a cryptocurrency, it is actually a platform that uses the currency Ether. The purpose of the platform is to draw up ‘smart contracts’ and conduct transactions, and these processes are fueled by ETH.
