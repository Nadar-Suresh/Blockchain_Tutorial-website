### Definition of blockchain
Smart contracts are essentially programmable arbitrary rules that are executed automatically on the blockchain when the predefined conditions are satisfied. For example, they can be used to facilitate the exchange of money, property, information and digital assets.

Deploying a smart contract on a blockchain means that they are usually public and transparent. This ensures that no interference could disrupt the conditions necessary for the transaction and the transaction. This creates a trustless environment in which two transacting parties will not require a third party intermediary to verify the transaction.

Traditionally individuals or institutions such as banks and solicitors are required to facilitate legally binding contracts. Smart contracts allow individuals to bypass these costly middlemen. This usually translates to saving of cost and time.

Smart contracts are first introduced on the Ethereum blockchain. They are applications design to run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine(public Blockchain). This is a decentralized “world computer” where the computing power is provided by all those Ethereum nodes. Any nodes providing computing power are rewarded for their contribution in Ether tokens.

### Features of blockchain
* __Autonomy__: Decentralized nature of the blockchain contracts underlying these smart contracts as well as the nature of the contract themselves means no outside party is required in the process.
* __Increase in security__: Blockchain technology creates unalterable ledgers which provide definitive proof of transactions. It also relies on encryption while operating as a secure peer to peer transaction system.
* __Faster settlement__: Without the need for a middleman, the time required for blockchain transaction to happen is reduced from traditional transaction.
* __Increased accuracy__: Humans make mistakes, smart contracts are designed not to.
* __Cost savings__: Automated process lowers costs significantly.
* __Trust__: Unalterable ledgers mean transactions are set in stone
* __Backup__: Data storage devices can fail. Smart contracts duplicate all transactions so that all parties have a record of the transitions. The likelihood that all parties are going to suffer data storage failures is practically nonexistent.

### Advantages of Smart Contracts
* Elimination of third party in deal making saves time and reduces possible confusions.
* NEO blockchain based platforms offer enhance data safety and maintenance of transaction history.
* Decentralized feature adds more security as data can be stored on different server points. As a result, it is difficult to hack data.
* Crypto currency can be transferred in the most secured manner on systems that are powered by blockchain technology.
* Chance of mistakes has been significantly reduced in money transaction for creating deals.
* Transaction information of affiliate or loyalty programs is also secured on platforms that have been developed on powered platform.

### Disadvantages of Smart Contracts
Along with many advantages, it also comes with a few disadvantages.
* Smart contract based on blockchain framework is a new concept. Thus, people have limited knowledge on it.
* Making changes or altering transaction information is not possible with smart contracts. It is advantageous as it maintains transparency. But, it could be daunting when a transaction happens by mistake.
* Third party agents do not disappear completely as they get new role.

Successful business marketing or referral programs can be led with smart contracts. Many businesses have already reaped various advantages of this system
